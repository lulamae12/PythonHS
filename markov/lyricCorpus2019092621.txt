Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day
With this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Come alone on my place
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen a mission

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you, yeah
More people wanna be, you don't trust no one

Tell me why I can get no relief
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Ay, mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I'll do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Ahahah, yeah

When you leave me, made me jump out of my room
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't ever met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need it quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my women for some diamonds and a coupe

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ay

I'ma pull up in a Bentley with a fuckin' hundred thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfucking bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Begging on my knees on to the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ay

Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm a ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me now; you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you and all the hoes

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways

Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ball for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ball for me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah


I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit, couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought you were gonna do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

Save my breath, but I lost faith a long time ago
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You're my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself of the ugly truth (what an ungly truth)
We're no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (and we can make it through)

My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the take was comin'
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

Save my breath, but I lost faith a long time ago
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope
I don't even wanna know why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?


It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to-

Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay


I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy
Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Everyday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, ay
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all
You can't blame it on me, ay
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
