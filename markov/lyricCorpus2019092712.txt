Yo
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (blllt)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar
Even have an opinion if you, you mention me
Millions of views, attention the news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give a shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut now
When it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll just turn around and just be like
"Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us?" (ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry
I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumbling but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do, where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole
Or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK, you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned and you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it 'cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be, regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom if I don't
Pull myself from the jaws of defeat
And rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached
My enemies die
I don't ceasefire till at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man!
That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange
Oh my God, that's a reach"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date"
"Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple"
"No it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scared to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person
To see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
They can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been panning my album to death
So I been giving the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners


Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah), sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch), eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo), wanna be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who made it, it's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say that we're cut from the same cloth but I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the latter day saints
Manic states, even padded with automatic stay pray
Gat anything that may stay in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a tray eh, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman can't take anymore
But I try to get away from the anger and rage my basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs ain't givin' ways ankle
The ways you chumps don't even know how to do somethin' to give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat if you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell the-
Bar for me what I rap, is it there?
But, guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell you
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
But you better take it back to the shelter and Hamburger Helper 'cause dammit I'm still the...

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I misprounouced a name
"Die antwoord!"
Fuck! I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by monks
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window, somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it an Austral 'cause it's not-gonna-ever
I'll never let up on the pedal might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wiping everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I fee like I'm the...

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like I flunked suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped ISIS with a ISIS flag, bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that I'm finna hip back till I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic like similar to pistol squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine drinking, [?] gets mean
Bars on these boys when I split them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'ma sting like a bee you ain't harming a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing, I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali 'cause I know one day I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkey sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest


Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop all like a Uno (bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant until the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die, I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say "What a wonderful feeling!"
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is sealing, like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps, it's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat
We need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact with a old-me at the same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know a button to press or a lever to pull
They give me the snap though (bitch)
And if I payin' attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink in a minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker know I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote till the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ay
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaws
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a rider mighta fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice


Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how-

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over; kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted?
I'm with someone so unlikeable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face till I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skrt off
And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?


Aye yo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not thrilled about the video
What does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Well I'll show him who's really bad

Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough
Do you remember the time we were watching the Billy Jean video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me, and it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons, and I hope they all fucking die

How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him, but I can't

Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry

Anyways, call me back, I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun (Goddamn it)


Its 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge
Watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it
Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was running shit till we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was going through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hoping they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did
More than try talking you into coming up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we would've politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washing my sins in it till my conscious is clear

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Bacardi in hand
Never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift
All the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get?
For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift
A Freudian slip
Subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess they're just ownin' for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here
But that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to
But I'm fighting for air
I'm barely charting myself
Feels like I'm under the sink

But it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road
Done all we possibly can
I know we kept up our hopes
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones


Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Yeah

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (whoa)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spyder move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Capri styles, am I a G?
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all in the stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down
We can no give a fuck, shit, a fucking Kehlani
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants
You niggas

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ay)
The people you run with are fucking (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ay)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery, bitch, you ain't plugged in nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put up
Strap on, in other words if you're a gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
It's tough to me now, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfucker, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, really, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy, cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Soldier in my soul and I told them the moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, it's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is groper, I roleplay with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Roll dice to globe in and I'm (??) tryna throw in (?)
They both hate to choke and my hoe play the (?)
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formiddable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, solider
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One mother older
Sponge, mob, colder
None, rug, hoaster
Lug, nut, coaster
Lung, jug roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic
(Man, fuck this shit; let's go)


You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my-

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You want it, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body baggage zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "he ain't spit like this in his last shit"
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up"
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy

Just remember-I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Brush my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire


Okay, how do I say this? (fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fucking kamikaze crashing into everything
You beat me Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been going for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome
Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I T-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned on rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I wasn't
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by
Dre's Frankenstein, energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, buy some rope on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryna stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda' let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, is me rear ending Terreri Bear
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair with [?] beware
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serially killing every therapist, is it-

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feeling something evil is lurking
I'm no conspiracy theorist but something here is afoot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurement stick (what)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been going for your jugular like Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait till I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot


You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
Right?! Sike!

Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man

I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it

I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
Right?! Sike!

Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch

I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael Polar
You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola

I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh)
Everything over-affects me (yeah)
When you joke it upsets me (yeah)
You say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh)
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep)
You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep)
Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh)
Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin' to house sit
In that outfit, no skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing, why
Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?


Here we go again from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E-lope would be dope
But what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's probably screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here comes the rays like wind, you get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!"
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in

Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, "You're the good guy"
They like, they like, they like, "You're the good guy"


I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off till you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like-

Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-l-l-let us in!"
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure-hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Medal win, went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, to Scribble Jam and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said "hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely could wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the-)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the-)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun
Like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Throw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, the back of it-just mangled steel
My Mustang and your Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the-)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum

(When they get bit with the-)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliot phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake bitten with my-venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot
Tied for the uppercut, tie a couple knots
Fired up a Glock, fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitches goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not? You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a-parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
